# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project uses a third-party API to access weather data from openweathermap.org to build an application that shows current weather, along with a five-day forecast for a given city. Using an API key, the data needed for this application is collected by making API requests with specific parameters included within the URL.

- The motivation for this project is to provide users with a tool to facilitate improved travel planning.
- This application was built to provide end users with convenience, options, and weather-based contingencies before and while traveling.
- Users have an alternative source for weather data.
- Lesson: There seems to be information available via APIs than GUIs.
